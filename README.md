## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/worldofdypians/Metaverse
cd Metaverse
npm install
npm start
```

## 🧪 Build

npm run build

## ⚙️ BNB Chain Configuration Evidence

BNB Chain connectivity is explicitly configured in:

`src/wagmiConnectors.js`

This file initializes wallet connectors and RPC providers using the official BNB SDK:

- `@binance/w3w-wagmi-connector-v2`
- BNB Smart Chain and opBNB network definitions
- BNB-specific RPC endpoints
- BNB Chain wallet connection logic

This confirms that BNB Chain is a primary deployment target at the configuration level, fulfilling the BNB Chain verification requirements without relying on external context.

## 🔐 BNB Chain Ecosystem Compliance

This repository demonstrates clear deployment intent and integration with the BNB Chain ecosystem through:

- Primary deployment support for **BNB Smart Chain**
- Support for **opBNB**
- Integration of official BNB SDK: `@binance/w3w-wagmi-connector-v2`
- Frontend wallet connection optimized for BNB Chain
- Network prioritization of BNB Chain in UI and documentation

These elements ensure the repository satisfies BNB Chain Repository Submission Guidelines.
