              <p className="text-white m-0">
                1.1. Description of the Services. The Services offer a unique
                metaverse gaming experience via the Game and other related
                experiences through the combination of traditional core game and
                blockchain mechanics (the “World of Dypians”). The World of
                Dypians is driven by WOD tokens. WOD serves as the native
                in-Game currency used for in-Game economic interactions, such as
                purchasing resources, items, gear, skins, and other in-Game
                assets. You acknowledge and agree that we cannot be held liable
                or responsible in any way for any damages or losses incurred by
                any person in connection with with any acts or omissions of the
                World of Dypians.
              </p>
              <p className="text-white m-0">
                1.2. DACs. The World of Dypians utilizes a guild system that
                allows you to create factions and collectives that operate in a
                decentralized, autonomous way (“Decentralized Autonomous
                Corporations”). The Services may provide you and other players
                with certain tools that enable the implementation and management
                of such Decentralized Autonomous Corporations. We reserve the
                right to revoke access from any Decentralized Autonomous
                Corporation, or member player thereof, to such tools in the
                event that such Decentralized Autonomous Corporation or player
                violates these Terms or for any other reason we determine in our
                good faith business judgment.
              </p>
              <p className="text-white m-0">
                1.3. Game Items. The Services provide a shop (the “Shop”) for
                you to purchase, transfer, and trade Game-related items such as
                resources, and other items (“Game Items”); provided that any
                Game Items that we indicate are “soulbound” to you shall be
                non-transferable and non-tradable (including with respect to any
                Game NFTs asociated with such Game Items) from the Digital
                Wallet that such Game Items are first stored (“Soulbound
                Items”). Game Items can be used in the Services in various ways
                that we make available, such as to represent in-Game assets that
                you can use while you play the Game. We make no promises or
                guarantees regarding the functionality, utility, or value of any
                Game Items, and such Game Items may evolve and change as we
                update and modify the Game.
              </p>
              <p className="text-white m-0">
                1.4. Game NFTs. Your purchase of Game Items may be accompanied
                by non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”), and your ownership of these
                NFTs is tracked via the specified blockchain (“Game NFTs”). Your
                ownership of these Game NFTs will give you certain rights and
                privileges within the Services, for as long as we make the
                Services and such rights and privileges available to you. You
                are responsible for all payments, fees, and costs when engaging
                in any transactions involving Game NFTs, including, without
                limitation, the purchase price, transaction fees, fees
                associated with your secondary or subsequent sales of Game NFTs,
                and all other fees associated with your use of the Game NFTs via
                the Services.
              </p>
              <p className="text-white m-0">
                1.5. Shop. We provide the Shop to be able to sell Game Items and
                other Services-related offerings (collectively, “Offerings”) to
                you directly from us. The Shop will also facilitate peer-to-peer
                sales conducted via decentralized or third-party exchanges or
                protocols whereby buyers and sellers can buy, sell, and trade
                Game NFTs (other than Soulbound Items) with each other. We may
                charge a transaction fee on all peer-to-peer sales that occur
                via the Shop or that otherwise involve Game NFTs (which may be
                calculated as a percentage of the overall sale price of the Game
                Items). We may offer ways to receive a discount on such
                transaction fees, such as by holding or staking certain
                Services-related tokens and assets. The scope of, and
                pre-requisitions for receiving any, such discount offers are
                subject to change by us in our sole discretion at any time. To
                facilitate transactions via the Shop, we have integrated with
                one or more third-party exchanges and services or other
                decentralized smart contract protocols. These protocols
                facilitate, on a peer-to-peer basis, the exchange of
                cryptocurrency and other assets through the Solana blockchain.
                We do not own or control these third-party or decentralized
                services, we do not control the transfer of cryptocurrency or
                digital assets, including Game NFTs, using these third-party
                services or decentralized services, and we do not have the
                ability to cancel or reverse transactions via the Shop. Except
                as may otherwise be provided in these Terms, we do not control
                or endorse purchases or sales of Game NFTs or other Offerings
                outside of the Services, including the Shop. With respect to
                Game NFTs that are not sold directly by us, we are not a party
                to any agreement entered into between an end user buyer and a
                seller on the Shop. Other than with respect to items sold
                directly by us, we have no control over the conduct of buyers,
                sellers, and any other users of the Shop. We accept no liability
                for any aspect of the buyer and seller peer-to-peer interaction
                on the Shop.
              </p>
              <p className="text-white m-0">
                1.6. Digital Wallet. To use certain of the Services, you need to
                link to the Services via a non-custodial digital wallet made
                available by third parties (a “Third-Party Wallet”), and that is
                compatible with different networks and Services (a “Digital
                Wallet”). A list of supported wallets will be displayed by us,
                such as on the Website. Linking a Digital Wallet to the Services
                is required to be able to purchase, store, and engage in
                transactions using the Services, such as to connect your Game
                NFTs and WOD tokens with the Services. We may not be able to
                help you recover assets associated with your Digital Wallet, as
                these are non-custodial wallets in your control. We do not own
                or control the assets associated with your Digital Wallet. We
                accept no responsibility or liability to you in connection with
                your use of a Digital Wallet and make no representations or
                warranties regarding how the Services will operate with any
                specific Digital Wallet. The private keys, credentials,
                passwords, seed phrases, or secret recovery passphrases
                necessary to decrypt or gain access to a Digital Wallet are held
                solely by you, and not by us. If you choose to transfer items
                from one Digital Wallet to another, such transfers will occur on
                the public blockchain and we accept no liability or
                responsibility for any such transfer, including for any loss,
                data corruption, or other negative impact that may occur to your
                Offerings or Digital Wallets or other assets when attempting to
                transfer assets between Digital Wallets. We reserve the right,
                with or without prior notice and in our sole and complete
                discretion, to discontinue, modify, or limit the operation of
                any Digital Wallet with the Services. You represent and warrant
                that you are the lawful owner of any Digital Wallet and that you
                are using that Digital Wallet under the terms and conditions of
                the applicable provider of the Digital Wallet. To the extent
                that you use a Third-Party Wallet, the following additional
                terms apply: Third-Party Wallets are not associated with,
                maintained by, controlled by, or affiliated with us. If you have
                any issues with your Third-Party Wallet, please contact the
                applicable provider. You represent and warrant that you are the
                lawful owner of any Third-Party Wallet and that you are using
                that Third-Party Wallet under the terms and conditions of the
                applicable provider of the Third-Party Wallet.
              </p>
              <p className="text-white m-0">
                1.7. Promotional Codes. We may offer certain promotional codes,
                referral codes, discount codes, coupon codes, or similar offers
                (“Promotional Codes”) that may be redeemed for discounts on
                future Offerings, or other features or benefits related to the
                Services, subject to any additional terms that the Company
                establishes. You agree that Promotional Codes: (a) must be used
                in a lawful manner; (b) must be used for the intended audience
                and purpose; (c) may not be duplicated, sold, or transferred in
                any manner, or made available by you to the general public
                (whether posted to a public forum, coupon collecting service, or
                otherwise), unless expressly permitted by the Company; (d) may
                be disabled or have additional conditions applied to them by the
                Company at any time for any reason without liability to the
                Company; (e) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms
                that the Company establishes for such Promotional Code; (f) are
                not valid for cash or other credits or points; and (g) may

              <p className="text-white m-0">
                1.8. Changes and Pricing. We may, at any time, revise or change
                the pricing, availability, specifications, content,
                descriptions, or features of any Offerings sold by us, and to
                correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur (and to
                cancel any orders in our sole discretion that were purchased
                with pricing errors). All such changes shall be effective
                immediately upon posting of such new Offerings prices to the
                Services. While we attempt to be as accurate as we can in our
                descriptions for the Offerings, we do not warrant that Offerings
                descriptions are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or
                error-free. The inclusion of any Offerings for purchase through
                the Services at a particular time does not imply or warrant that
                the Offerings will be available at any other time. We reserve
                the right to change prices for Offerings displayed on the
                Services at any time.
              </p>
              <p className="text-white m-0">
                1.9. Purchases Made for Consumptive Use. You acknowledge and
                affirm that you are acquiring Offerings, whether through the
                Shop or otherwise through the Services, for purposes of use in
                connection with the Services and, in the case of the Game NFTs,
                to play the Game or for other collectible purposes, and in each
                case not for any investment or speculative purposes. Any
                economic benefit that may be derived from appreciation in the
                value of an Offering or Game NFT is incidental to obtaining it
                for its use in connection with the Services or its collectible
                purpose.

                LAW OR REGULATION (AND IN SUCH INSTANCES WHERE REQUIRED BY
                APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO ISSUE ANY SUCH REFUND
                IS LIMITED TO WHETHER THE APPLICABLE SMART CONTRACT ENABLES THE

                FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER

                from the Company constitutes tax advice, and users are solely
                responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to their
                interaction with Offerings and the Services.

                8.7. Force Majeure. We will not be liable or responsible to you,
                nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached these Terms,
                for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any of our
                obligations under these Terms or in operating the Services, when
                and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results

              <p className="text-white m-0">9. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS</p>
              <p className="text-white m-0">
                9.1. Updating These Terms. We may modify these Terms from time
                to time in which case we will update the “Last Revised On” date
                at the top of these Terms. If we make changes that are material,
                we will use reasonable efforts to attempt to notify you.
                However, it is your sole responsibility to review these Terms
                from time to time to view any such changes. The updated Terms
                will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date
                as may be specified in the updated Terms. Your continued access
                or use of the Services after the modifications have become
                effective will be deemed your acceptance of the modified Terms.
              </p>
              <p className="text-white m-0">
                9.2. Termination of License and Your Account. If you breach any
                of the provisions of these Terms, all licenses granted by the
                Company will terminate automatically. Additionally, the Company
                may suspend, disable, or delete your Account and/or the Services
                (or any part of the foregoing) with or without notice, for any
                or no reason. If the Company deletes your Account for any
                suspected breach of these Terms by you, you are prohibited from
                re-registering for the Services under a different name or wallet
                address. In the event of Account deletion for any reason, the
                Company may, but is not obligated to, delete any of Your
                Content. The Company shall not be responsible for the deletion
                of or failure to delete Your Content. All sections which by
                their nature should survive the termination of these Terms shall
                continue in full force and effect subsequent to and
                notwithstanding any termination of these Terms by the Company or
                you. Termination will not limit any of the Company’s other
                rights or remedies at law or in equity.

              <p className="text-white m-0">
                9.3. Injunctive Relief. You agree that a breach of these Terms
                will cause irreparable injury to the Company for which monetary
                damages would not be an adequate remedy and the Company shall be
                entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may
                have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security, or
                proof of damages.

              <p className="text-white m-0">
                9.4. Miscellaneous. If any provision of these Terms shall be
                unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that
                provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall
                not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
                provisions. These Terms and the licenses granted hereunder may
                be assigned by the Company but may not be assigned by you
                without the prior express written consent of the Company. No
                waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall
                be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach
                or default. The section headings used herein are for reference
                only and shall not be read to have any legal effect. The
                Services are operated by us in the United States. Those who
                choose to access the Services from locations outside the United
                States do so at their own initiative and are responsible for
                compliance with applicable local laws.
