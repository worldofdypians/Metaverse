            </p>
            <p className="text-white m-0">
              1.1. Description of the Services. The Services offer a unique
              metaverse gaming experience via the Game and other related
              experiences through the combination of traditional core game and
              blockchain mechanics (the “World of Dypians”). The World of
              Dypians is driven by a dual token system — “DYP” and “iDYP”. DYP
              serves as the native in-Game currency used for in-Game economic
              interactions, such as purchasing resources, items, gear, skins,
              and other in-Game assets. iDYP is a multifunctional token, which
              has in-Game applications used for energy, stamina, and other
              in-Game functionalities. You acknowledge and agree that we cannot
              be held liable or responsible in any way for any damages or losses
              incurred by any person in connection with with any acts or
              omissions of the World of Dypians.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white m-0">
              1.2. DACs. The World of Dypians utilizes a guild system that
              allows you to create factions and collectives that operate in a
              decentralized, autonomous way (“Decentralized Autonomous
              Corporations”). The Services may provide you and other players
              with certain tools that enable the implementation and management
              of such Decentralized Autonomous Corporations. We reserve the
              right to revoke access from any Decentralized Autonomous
              Corporation, or member player thereof, to such tools in the event
              that such Decentralized Autonomous Corporation or player violates
              these Terms or for any other reason we determine in our good faith
              business judgment.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white m-0">
              1.3. Game Items. The Services provide a marketplace (the
              “Marketplace”) for you to purchase, transfer, and trade
              Game-related items such as resources, and other items (“Game
              Items”); provided that any Game Items that we indicate are
              “soulbound” to you shall be non-transferable and non-tradable
              (including with respect to any Game NFTs asociated with such Game
              Items) from the Digital Wallet that such Game Items are first
              stored (“Soulbound Items”). Game Items can be used in the Services
              in various ways that we make available, such as to represent
              in-Game assets that you can use while you play the Game. We make
              no promises or guarantees regarding the functionality, utility, or
              value of any Game Items, and such Game Items may evolve and change
              as we update and modify the Game.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white m-0">
              1.4. Game NFTs. Your purchase of Game Items may be accompanied by
              non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”), and your ownership of these NFTs is
              tracked via the specified blockchain (“Game NFTs”). Your ownership
              of these Game NFTs will give you certain rights and privileges
              within the Services, for as long as we make the Services and such
              rights and privileges available to you. You are responsible for
              all payments, fees, and costs when engaging in any transactions
              involving Game NFTs, including, without limitation, the purchase
              price, transaction fees, fees associated with your secondary or
              subsequent sales of Game NFTs, and all other fees associated with
              your use of the Game NFTs via the Services.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white m-0">
              1.5. Marketplace. We provide the Marketplace to be able to sell
              Game Items and other Services-related offerings (collectively,
              “Offerings”) to you directly from us. The Marketplace will also
              facilitate peer-to-peer sales conducted via decentralized or
              third-party exchanges or protocols whereby buyers and sellers can
              buy, sell, and trade Game NFTs (other than Soulbound Items) with
              each other. We may charge a transaction fee on all peer-to-peer
              sales that occur via the Marketplace or that otherwise involve
              Game NFTs (which may be calculated as a percentage of the overall
              sale price of the Game Items). We may offer ways to receive a
              discount on such transaction fees, such as by holding or staking
              certain Services-related tokens and assets. The scope of, and
              pre-requisitions for receiving any, such discount offers are
              subject to change by us in our sole discretion at any time. To
              facilitate transactions via the Marketplace, we have integrated
              with one or more third-party exchanges and services or other
              decentralized smart contract protocols. These protocols
              facilitate, on a peer-to-peer basis, the exchange of
              cryptocurrency and other assets through the Solana blockchain. We
              do not own or control these third-party or decentralized services,
              we do not control the transfer of cryptocurrency or digital
              assets, including Game NFTs, using these third-party services or
              decentralized services, and we do not have the ability to cancel
              or reverse transactions via the Marketplace. Except as may
              otherwise be provided in these Terms, we do not control or endorse
              purchases or sales of Game NFTs or other Offerings outside of the
              Services, including the Marketplace. With respect to Game NFTs
              that are not sold directly by us, we are not a party to any
              agreement entered into between an end user buyer and a seller on
              the Marketplace. Other than with respect to items sold directly by
              us, we have no control over the conduct of buyers, sellers, and
              any other users of the Marketplace. We accept no liability for any
              aspect of the buyer and seller peer-to-peer interaction on the
              Marketplace.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white m-0">
              1.6. Digital Wallet. To use certain of the Services, you need to
              link to the Services via a non-custodial digital wallet made
              available by third parties (a “Third-Party Wallet”), and that is
              compatible with different networks and Services (a “Digital
              Wallet”). A list of supported wallets will be displayed by us,
              such as on the Website. Linking a Digital Wallet to the Services
              is required to be able to purchase, store, and engage in
              transactions using the Services, such as to connect your Game NFTs
              and DYP and iDYP tokens with the Services. We may not be able to
              help you recover assets associated with your Digital Wallet, as
              these are non-custodial wallets in your control. We do not own or
              control the assets associated with your Digital Wallet. We accept
              no responsibility or liability to you in connection with your use
              of a Digital Wallet and make no representations or warranties
              regarding how the Services will operate with any specific Digital
              Wallet. The private keys, credentials, passwords, seed phrases, or
              secret recovery passphrases necessary to decrypt or gain access to
              a Digital Wallet are held solely by you, and not by us. If you
              choose to transfer items from one Digital Wallet to another, such
              transfers will occur on the public blockchain and we accept no
              liability or responsibility for any such transfer, including for
              any loss, data corruption, or other negative impact that may occur
              to your Offerings or Digital Wallets or other assets when
              attempting to transfer assets between Digital Wallets. We reserve
              the right, with or without prior notice and in our sole and
              complete discretion, to discontinue, modify, or limit the
              operation of any Digital Wallet with the Services. You represent
              and warrant that you are the lawful owner of any Digital Wallet
              and that you are using that Digital Wallet under the terms and
              conditions of the applicable provider of the Digital Wallet. To
              the extent that you use a Third-Party Wallet, the following
              additional terms apply: Third-Party Wallets are not associated
              with, maintained by, controlled by, or affiliated with us. If you
              have any issues with your Third-Party Wallet, please contact the
              applicable provider. You represent and warrant that you are the
              lawful owner of any Third-Party Wallet and that you are using that
              Third-Party Wallet under the terms and conditions of the
              applicable provider of the Third-Party Wallet.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white m-0">
              1.7. Promotional Codes. We may offer certain promotional codes,
              referral codes, discount codes, coupon codes, or similar offers
              (“Promotional Codes”) that may be redeemed for discounts on future
              Offerings, or other features or benefits related to the Services,
              subject to any additional terms that the Company establishes. You
              agree that Promotional Codes: (a) must be used in a lawful manner;
              (b) must be used for the intended audience and purpose; (c) may
              not be duplicated, sold, or transferred in any manner, or made
              available by you to the general public (whether posted to a public
              forum, coupon collecting service, or otherwise), unless expressly
              permitted by the Company; (d) may be disabled or have additional
              conditions applied to them by the Company at any time for any
              reason without liability to the Company; (e) may only be used
              pursuant to the specific terms that the Company establishes for
              such Promotional Code; (f) are not valid for cash or other credits
              or points; and (g) may expire prior to your use.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white m-0">
              1.8. Changes and Pricing. We may, at any time, revise or change
              the pricing, availability, specifications, content, descriptions,
              or features of any Offerings sold by us, and to correct pricing
              errors that may inadvertently occur (and to cancel any orders in
              our sole discretion that were purchased with pricing errors). All
              such changes shall be effective immediately upon posting of such
              new Offerings prices to the Services. While we attempt to be as
              accurate as we can in our descriptions for the Offerings, we do
              not warrant that Offerings descriptions are accurate, complete,
              reliable, current, or error-free. The inclusion of any Offerings
              for purchase through the Services at a particular time does not
              imply or warrant that the Offerings will be available at any other
              time. We reserve the right to change prices for Offerings
              displayed on the Services at any time.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white m-0">
              1.9. Purchases Made for Consumptive Use. You acknowledge and
              affirm that you are acquiring Offerings, whether through the
              Marketplace or otherwise through the Services, for purposes of use
              in connection with the Services and, in the case of the Game NFTs,
              to play the Game or for other collectible purposes, and in each
              case not for any investment or speculative purposes. Any economic
              benefit that may be derived from appreciation in the value of an
              Offering or Game NFT is incidental to obtaining it for its use in
              connection with the Services or its collectible purpose.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white m-0">
              1.10. ALL SALES FINAL. ALL PURCHASES MADE THROUGH THE SERVICES ARE
              FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
              REGULATION (AND IN SUCH INSTANCES WHERE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
              LAW, THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO ISSUE ANY SUCH REFUND IS LIMITED TO
              WHETHER THE APPLICABLE SMART CONTRACT ENABLES THE COMPANY TO
              REASONABLY REVERSE OR CANCEL A TRANSACTION). NEVERTHELESS, YOU
              ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT IN MOST CASES HAVE THE
              ABILITY TO REVERSE OR CANCEL A TRANSACTION AND IS NOT REQUIRED OR
              OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE A REFUND OF ANY PURCHASE FOR ANY REASON, AND
              THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR TIME,
              ITEMS, AMOUNTS, OR VALUES IN A GAME ACCOUNT (INCLUDING ANY UNUSED
              OR PARTIAL USED MEMBERSHIP TIME), EVEN IF AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED,
              WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.

              3.1. Eligibility. You must be 13 years of age or older to use the
              Services. Additional aspects of the Services may have further age
              restrictions that will be presented to you in connection with
              those Services. Minors under the age of majority in their
              jurisdiction but that are at least 13 years of age are only
              permitted to use the Services if the minor’s parent or guardian or
              other holder of parental authority accepts these Terms on the
              minor’s behalf prior to use of the Services. Children under the
              age of 13 are not permitted to use the Services. Further, if you
              use the Services, you may not transfer or provide to us any
              currency, digital assets, or other items that have been derived
              from any illegal or unlawful activity. By using the Services, you

              as a unique identifier for you in respect of your use of the
              Services, we may additionally require you to create an account in
              order to use certain portions of the Services (to the extent
              applicable, your “Account”). To the extent that we require you to
              create an Account, we will provide you with instructions on how to
              do so, and once created, how to access, edit, and update your
              Account. In your creation, editing, or updating of any such

              risks associated with purchasing and holding NFTs and using
              blockchain technology. These include, but are not limited to, risk
              of losing access to NFTs due to loss of a PIN, wallet keys, seed
              phrases, two-factor authentication devices, or log-in information,
              user error when transferring NFTs, custodial error or purchaser
              error, smart contract error, risk of blockchain attacks, risk of
              hacking and security weaknesses, risk of unfavorable regulatory
              intervention in one or more jurisdictions, risks related to token
              taxation, risk of personal information disclosure, risk of
              uninsured losses, unanticipated risks, and volatility risks. You
              acknowledge that you have obtained sufficient information to make
              an informed decision to purchase a Game NFT, including carefully
              reviewing the code of the smart contract and the NFT, and fully
              understand and accept the functions of the same. The regulatory
              regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and
              tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may
              materially adversely affect the development of the Services, and
              therefore the potential utility or value of your Game NFTs.
              Upgrades to any blockchain network or hard forks in such networks,
              or a change in how transactions are confirmed on such blockchain
              networks, may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains,

              taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by
              any governmental authority associated with your use of the
              Services. Except for income taxes levied on us, you: (a) will be
              solely responsible for reporting any tax obligations when, if
              ever, such obligations arise as a result of your use of the
              Services or in relation to an Offering; (b) will pay or reimburse
              Company for all national, federal, state, local, or other taxes
              and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes
              and other taxes as may be required, and amounts levied in lieu
              thereof based on charges set, services performed, or payments made
              hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the
              authority of any national, state, local, or any other taxing
              jurisdiction; and (c) will not be entitled to deduct the amount of
              any such taxes, duties, or assessments from payments (including
              transaction fees) made to us pursuant to these Terms. Neither
              these Terms nor any other communication from the Company
              constitutes tax advice, and users are solely responsible for
              determining what, if any, taxes apply to their interaction with
              Offerings and the Services.

              obligations under these Terms or in operating the Services, when
              and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results
              from any events beyond the Company’s ability to control, including
              acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, epidemics, pandemics,

              9.1. Updating These Terms. We may modify these Terms from time to
              time in which case we will update the “Last Revised On” date at
              the top of these Terms. If we make changes that are material, we
              will use reasonable efforts to attempt to notify you. However, it
              is your sole responsibility to review these Terms from time to
              time to view any such changes. The updated Terms will be effective
              as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified
              in the updated Terms. Your continued access or use of the Services
              after the modifications have become effective will be deemed your
              acceptance of the modified Terms.

              9.2. Termination of License and Your Account. If you breach any of

              any part of the foregoing) with or without notice, for any or no
              reason. If the Company deletes your Account for any suspected
              breach of these Terms by you, you are prohibited from
              re-registering for the Services under a different name or wallet
              address. In the event of Account deletion for any reason, the
              Company may, but is not obligated to, delete any of Your Content.
              The Company shall not be responsible for the deletion of or
              failure to delete Your Content. All sections which by their nature

              full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any
              termination of these Terms by the Company or you. Termination will
              not limit any of the Company’s other rights or remedies at law or
              in equity.

              entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may
